# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Static Site Deployment

This is a frontend React application that can be deployed as a static site. After building:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **GitHub Pages** (already configured)
- **Netlify**
- **Vercel**
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- **Firebase Hosting**
- **Surge.sh**

### Build Output

The build process creates static files in the `build/` directory:

```
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code (if using SSR)
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
